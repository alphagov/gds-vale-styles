# GDS A-Z style guide

This content was copied on 3 Oct 2019 from https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style

## A
A*, A*s
The top grade in GCSEs and A levels. Use the symbol * not the word ‘star’. No apostrophe in the plural.

A level
No hyphen. Lower case level.

### Abbreviations and acronyms
The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page unless it’s well known, like UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT and MP. This includes government departments or schemes. Then refer to it by initials, and use acronym Markdown so the full explanation is available as hover text.

If you think an acronym is well known, please provide evidence that 80% of the UK population will understand and commonly use it. Evidence can be from search analytics or testing of a representative sample.

Do not use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

the academies programme
Lower case.

academy
Only use upper case when referring to the name of an academy, like Mossbourne Community Academy. See also Titles.

academy converters
Lower case.

academy order
Lower case.

academy trust
Lower case.

Access to Work
Upper case when referring directly to the actual programme, otherwise use lower case.

accountancy service provider
Upper case when referring to the business area covered by Money Laundering Regulations. Do not use the acronym.

Accounts Office
Upper case.

Activation PIN
Upper case. Activation PIN has been changed to Activation Code on outgoing correspondence from the Government Gateway. Until all hard-coded instances of Activation PIN have been removed from the Online Services pages, use ‘Activation Code (also known as Activation PIN)’.

### act, act of Parliament
Lower case. Only use upper case when using the full title: Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, for example.

### Active voice
Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, clear content.

### Addressing the user
Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action: ‘You can contact HMRC by phone and email’ or ‘Pay your car tax’, for example.

Adoption Register
Upper case when referring to the national Adoption Register.

Lower case in subsequent mentions that do not use the full term: the register.

adviser
For example, special adviser. Not advisor, but advisory is the correct adjective.

### ages
Do not use hyphens in ages unless to avoid confusion, although it’s always best to write in a way that avoids ambiguity. For example, ‘a class of 15 16-year-old students took the A level course’ can be written as ‘15 students aged 16 took the A level course’.

### agile
Upper case when referring to the Agile Manifesto and principles and processes, otherwise use lower case.

al-Qa’ida
Not al-Qaeda’ or ‘al-Qaida.

alternative provision
Lower case.

### Americanisms
Do not use Americanisms. You fill in a form, not fill out a form.

Exceptions include where it’s part of a specific name: 4th Mechanized Brigade, for example.

Use the -ise rather than -ize suffix: organise not organize, for example (this is not actually an Americanism but is often seen as such).

### Ampersand
Use and rather than &, unless it’s a department’s logo image or a company’s name as it appears on the Companies House register.

animal health
Lower case.

antisocial
No hyphen.

applied general qualifications
Lower case.

apprenticeship programme
Lower case.

A-road
Hyphenated.

armed forces
Lower case.

arm’s length body
Apostrophe, no hyphen.

## B
Bacs (Bankers Automated Clearing System)
Acronym should come first as it’s more widely known than the full name. Please note that the acronym has changed to Bacs.

### backend
Used in a technical context, not “back-end” or “back end”.

### Bank details
When adding bank details in content about paying a government body:

use spaces rather than hyphens in sort codes - 60 70 80 (not 60-70-80)
do not use spaces in account numbers - 10025634

### Banned words
See Words to avoid

### baseline
One word, lower case.

Behavioural Insights team
Upper case if it’s a specific, named team. Always lower case for team and generic names like research team, youth offending team.

Bereavement Payment
Upper case.

Blind Person’s Allowance
Upper case.

### blog post
Use 2 words when referring to an article published on a blog. A ‘blog’ is the site on which a blog post is published.

### board
Always lower case unless it’s part of a proper title: so upper case for the Judicial Executive Board, but lower case for the DFT’s management board.

### bold
Only use bold to refer to text from interfaces in technical documentation or instructions.

You can use bold to explain what field a user needs to fill in on a form, or what button they need to select. For example: “Select Continue. The Verify Certificate window opens.”

Use bold sparingly - using too much will make it difficult for users to know which parts of your content they need to pay the most attention to.

Do not use bold in other situations, for example to emphasise text.

To emphasise words or phrases, you can:

front-load sentences
use headings
use bullets
borough council
Lower case except in a name: Northampton Borough Council.

### Brackets
Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech:

“Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.”

Do not use round brackets to refer to something that could either be singular or plural, like ‘Check which document(s) you need to send to DVLA.’

Always use the plural instead, as this will cover each possibility: ‘Check which documents you need to send to DVLA.’

Brexit
Not ‘EU Exit’.

### Britain
See Great Britain

BTEC National Diploma
Upper case.

### Bullet points and steps
You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

you always use a lead-in line
the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
you use lower case at the start of the bullet
you do not use more than one sentence per bullet point - use commas or dashes to expand on an item
you do not put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets
you do not make the whole bullet a link if it’s a long phrase
you do not put a semicolon at the end of a bullet
there is no full stop after the last bullet point
Bullets should normally form a complete sentence following from the lead text. But it’s sometimes necessary to add a short phrase to clarify whether all or some of the points apply. For example, ‘You can only register a pension scheme that is (one of the following):’

The number and type of examples in a list may lead the user to believe the list is exhaustive. This can be dealt with by:

checking if there are other conditions (or if the list is actually complete)
listing the conditions which apply to the most users and removing the rest
consider broader terms in the list which capture more scenarios (and could make the list exhaustive)
creating a journey to specialist content to cover the remaining conditions
Steps
Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process. You do not need a lead-in line and you can use links and downloads (with appropriate Markdown) in steps. Steps end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.

specific select committees: Public Administration Select Committee
header cells in tables: Annual profits
titles of books (and within single quotes), for example, ‘The Study Skills Handbook’
World War 1 and World War 2 (note caps and numbers)

department or ministry - never Department or Ministry, unless referring to a specific one: Ministry of Justice, for example
white paper, green paper, command paper, House of Commons paper

policy themes like sustainable communities, promoting economic growth, local enterprise zones

There will be:

1 developing hazard in 13 clips
2 developing hazards in the other clip
Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression like ‘one or two of them’ where numerals would look strange.

For numerals over 999 - insert a comma for clarity: 9,000

agenda (unless it’s for a meeting)
advancing
collaborate (use working with)
combating
commit/pledge (we need to be more specific - we’re either doing something or we’re not)
countering
deliver (pizzas, post and services are delivered - not abstract concepts like improvements or priorities)
deploy (unless it’s military or software)
dialogue (we speak to people)
disincentivise (and incentivise)
empower
facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you’re helping)
focusing
foster (unless it’s children)
impact (do not use this as a synonym for have an effect on, or influence)
initiate
key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing is not key - it’s probably important)
land (as a verb only use if you’re talking about aircraft)
leverage (unless in the financial sense)
liaise
overarching
progress (as a verb - what are you actually doing?)
promote (unless you’re talking about an ad campaign or some other marketing promotion)

slimming down (processes do not diet)
streamline
strengthening (unless it’s strengthening bridges or other structures)
tackling (unless it’s rugby, football or some other sport)
transforming (what are you actually doing to change it?)
utilise
Avoid using metaphors – they do not say what you actually mean and lead to slower comprehension of your content. For example:

drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
drive out (unless it’s cattle)
going forward (it’s unlikely we are giving travel directions)
in order to (superfluous - do not use it)
one-stop shop (we are government, not a retail outlet)
ring fencing
With all of these words you can generally replace them by breaking the term into what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.
